# PAPPCompExamStudyBible
This holds files related to my Public Admin. / Public Policy Comp. Exam. Study Bible produced for the use of PhD students in political science in programs with PA/PP offerings.

## About This Repository
Welcome to my Git repository containing a master bib file with citation information for hundreds of sources in PA/PP politics. This bibliography includes a broad range of works relevant to the study of Public Administration and Public POlicy.

I should note that the bib file is far from clean—it includes some repeated entries and inconsistencies, but it is comprehensive and serves as a working resource for compiling citations efficiently. If you’re using this file, be prepared to do some manual cleaning.

Additionally, this repository includes a PDF guide for students preparing for Ph.D. minor comprehensive exams in PA/PP. This document provides detailed briefing memos on key political science texts, organized thematically across several major substantive areas.

## About the Guide
The Public Admin. / Public Policy Politics Comprehensive Exam Study Bible is a set of study notes that I compiled to assist in preparation for my minor Ph.D. comps. The guide is structured around major thematic areas.

Each section provides detailed summaries of key works, including discussions of theory, methods, and findings. While the guide is not a substitute for reading the original literature, it serves as a useful supplement for organizing and reviewing major debates in the field.

The guide reflects my experience as a Ph.D. student at the University of South Carolina in the mid-2020s, and while it is predominantly policy-oriented in focus, it covers a wide range of perspectives in administratin as well. The materials may not be exhaustive, but they include many foundational and modern texts.

I encourage you to verify any quotations against the original sources before using them in your own work.

How to use this repository: (1) The bib file can be imported into any reference management software (e.g., Zotero, Endnote, Mendeley, BibTeX) for easy citation tracking. (2) The PDF guide provides a structured overview of the field and serves as a reference tool for students preparing for exams or conducting research in American politics.

## Contributing and Cleaning the Bib File
